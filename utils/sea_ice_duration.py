        Following [18], after [5] and [26], annual maps of patterns of ice advance and duration were derived by flagging the timings of the advance and retreat of the ice edge within an annual search window that begins and ends during mean summer (mid-February) minimum ice extent (i.e., year day 46 to 410, or 411 in leap years). Within this period, annual day of advance is the time when the ice concentration in a given pixel first exceeds 15% (taken to approximate the ice edge) for at least 5 days, while day of retreat is the time when concentration remains below 15% until the end of the given sea ice year. Ice season duration is then the period between day of advance and retreat. For regions where ice remains (survives the summer melt), day of advance and retreat are set to the lower and upper limits, respectively i.e., year day 46 and 410/11. Isolated days of missing data were interpolated from adjoining days. Larger gaps during December 1987 through mid January 1988 were filled with the 1979â€“2009 climatology. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064756
