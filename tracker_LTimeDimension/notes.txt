This does work:

- I hacked the L.TimeDimension.Layer.wms._createLayerForTime function to produce the date format that PolarView expects for a wms layer. (Not sure why I needed to do this, maybe polarview is not standards compliant?)
- I dont really like the slider / date format, and there's no functionality to change the time interval on the fly, so it still needs a fair bit of work.

It does however have caching and forward/back buttons, which are handy.
